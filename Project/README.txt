Instructions to run:


Load the file "input_Task2.in" onto the prover9 and convert the question to be asked into a first order logic form using the predicates listed in "AI_KB_Predicates.pdf" and write in the goal section.
Prover9, using resolution refutation, will show a proof if the answer is an yes. if not negate the question (for an yes) and try again [as a question with no as an answer will get negated and then merge with the axioms in the KB (Prover9 will display exhausted)].

Files:

The "input_Task2.in" file contains the axioms of task 1 in its first order logic form. 

The file "KB.docx" contains the axioms in plain english.

The file "AI_KB_Predicates.pdf" contains the list of predicates used in the knowledge base and what they represent.

The file "Report.pdf" is the project report.

The file "AI_Project_questions.txt" gives an insighnt into the kind of questions this KNowledge Base was designed to answer and displays how these questions were framed.

There are files with names of the form input_Q*.in where * is replaced by a number. These indicate the questions that have been tested and the files with respective proofs are named as input_Q*.proof.
